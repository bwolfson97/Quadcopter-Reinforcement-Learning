# Quadcopter-Reinforcement-Learning

The final project of my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. I implement a teach a simulated quadcopter how to fly upwards by implementing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients algorithm using Python and Keras.

Starter code available [here](https://github.com/udacity/RL-Quadcopter-2).
